# PHP-CPG

Welcome to the PHP-CPG organization. This organization aims to collect, maintain, and distribute our PHP Code Property Graph implementation, related tooling, and references to projects using this code.

This organization was founded with our publication of `SSRF vs. Developers: A Study of SSRF-Defenses in PHP Applications`. 
If you depend on the CPG, please cite us:

## Patched PHP


## Code  Property Graph

Our Code Property Graph [repository](https://github.com/PHP-CPG/CPG) contains the code and tooling to convert PHP projects into a CPG.
At the moment, we only support PHP Bytecode, but we plan to eventually create passes for PHP Source Code.
You can create a docker container based on our Patched PHP interpreter and takes a project and returns a finished CPG.
