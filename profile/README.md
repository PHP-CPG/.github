# PHP-CPG

Welcome to the PHP-CPG organization. This org aims to collect, maintain, and distribute the our PHP Code Property Graph implementation as well as related tooling and references to projects using this code.

This organization was founded with our publication of `SSRF vs. Developers: A Study of SSRF-Defenses in PHP Applications`. If you depend on the CPG it would be nice if you cite us:
